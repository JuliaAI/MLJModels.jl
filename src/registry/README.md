The *MLJ Model Registry*, also known as the *model metadata database*,
is the current directory called file
[METADATA.toml](METADATA.toml). It is generated by loading all
packages in [Project.toml](Project.toml), searching for all types
implementing MLJ's model interface, and extracting [model
trait](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModelInterface.jl/blob/dev/src/MLJModelInterface.jl)
values for all such types. The abbreviated list of models in
[Models.toml](Models.toml) is generated at the same time.
